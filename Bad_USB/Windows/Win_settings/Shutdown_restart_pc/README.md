# Shutdown

Shutdown the computer

```powershell
shutdown /s
```

Default is 30 seconds to shutdown, so we make it 0

```powershell
/t 0
```

So the final code looks like

```powershell
shutdown /s /t 0
```

## Restart

```powershell
shutdown /r
```

Default is 30 seconds to shutdown, so we make it 0

```powershell
/t 0
```

So the final code looks like

```powershell
shutdown /r /t 0
```
